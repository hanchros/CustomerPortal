          <b>16. Arbitration.</b> Please read the following section carefully
          because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with
          Sponsor and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from
          Sponsor. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Sponsor seek
          to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the
          county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Sponsor
          seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful
          use of intellectual property, you and Sponsor waive your rights to a
          jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this
          Agreement or the Event resolved in court. Instead, all disputes
          arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Event will be
          resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in New York,
          New York in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
          Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
          Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby
          incorporated by reference. You acknowledge and agree that you have
          read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to
          read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair
          or should not apply for any reason. You and Sponsor agree that any
          dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Event is
          personal to you and Sponsor and that any dispute will be resolved
          solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a
          class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative
          proceeding. You and Sponsor agree that this Agreement affects
          interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will
          be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration
          Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent
          permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and
          the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make
          all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to
          grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided,
          however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a
          class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by
          this Agreement. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual
          arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims,
          preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside
          over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and
          Sponsor agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the
          filing fee and Sponsor will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For
          any arbitration initiated by Sponsor, Sponsor will pay all JAMS fees
          and costs. You and Sponsor agree that the state or federal courts of
          the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York, New
          York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement
          of an arbitration award. ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
          AGREEMENT OR THE MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE;
          OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND
          SPONSOR WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.

          to, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
          York, United States of America, excluding all conflict of law rules.

          States, respectively, sitting in New York, New York, except to the
          extent prohibited by applicable local law.
