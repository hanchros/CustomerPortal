          It applies whether you have provided the information directly to us or

          privacy notices provided to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you or your organization have
          previously entered into a separate, written agreement with IntegraLedger
          governing your existing use of the Services (“Subscriber Agreement”),
          any conflicting privacy terms of the Subscriber Agreement shall

        <p>
          <b>II. Information We Collect</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect some information directly from you (for example, via forms
          you complete or products or Services you access, download, or
          otherwise obtain). Such information is generally limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Name, job title, contact details, and company or organization;
          </li>
          <li>Your communications with CBI personnel;</li>
          <li>Content you post on our social media sites;</li>
          <li>
            Information you provide on the Website, such as online
            questionnaires, or feedback forms;
          </li>
          <li>
            Information you provide when you subscribe to email newsletters such
            as your interest in specific CBI research areas;
          </li>
          <li>Responses to surveys or other such best-practices studies;</li>
          <li>
            Information you provide when registering for a free trial account,
            log-in credentials and information about your use of and preferences

          <li>
            Limited billing information, collected and used strictly for billing
            purposes only, is not shared or used for any other purposes, and is
            and will be processed in accordance with all applicable laws. To be
            clear, CBI almost never collects billing information from
            individuals, as typically our offerings are paid by your company or
            organization. Other information is received indirectly from you via
            use of the Services or from your organization on your behalf (for
            example, from observing your actions on the Website or to provision
            you with account access). Such information is generally limited to:
          </li>
          <li>
            Information regarding usage of the Services or Website via web logs
            collected automatically and passively using various technologies,
            which generally will not specifically identify you or other
            individuals. Examples may include IP addresses, browser types,
            domain names, and other anonymous statistical data regarding
            aggregate usage;
          </li>
          <li>
            Download restrictions or other such consumption limits, where
            applicable, attributed to your CBI account, username, email address,
            registration, etc. Additionally, if you elect to download and use
            any optional third-party applications with the Services (for
            example, the CBI Chrome plugin), we will detect and store
            information necessary for you to effectively use the third-party
            application; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Information provided by your employer or organization, such as name,
            email, other contact information, job title, etc., in order to
            activate and manage your access to and use of the organization’s
            subscription to the Service. If you register for, or attend one of
            our events, conferences, networking/community offerings, we may:
          </li>
          <li>
            With your further consent, scan an attendee badge or QR code, which
            will provide contact information such as your name, title, company
            name, and email address;
          </li>
          <li>
            Record or otherwise broadcast conference presentations or locations;
            and
          </li>
          <li>
            Collect information regarding dietary requirements or any reasonable
            accommodations needed to attend and enjoy the event.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Lastly, we also collect Personal Data via other sources such as public
          records, publicly available sources or internet sites, vendors, data
          suppliers and service providers, commercially available marketing
          lists or registries, telephone directories, social networks (such as
          LinkedIn), news outlets and related media. Such Personal Data
          collected via these sources is typically limited to business contact
          information, such as names, contact information, job titles, IP
          addresses, and LinkedIn and other social media profiles.

        </p>
        <p>
          IntegraLedger is solely located in, and operates from, the United
          States. Additionally, we host our Services and process your Personal
          Data solely in the United States. However, it is possible that some of

          outside your jurisdiction, and in countries that are not subject to an
          adequacy decision by the European Commission or your local legislature
          and/or regulator, and that may not provide for the same level of data
          protection as your jurisdiction. We ensure that the information
          continues to be protected wherever it is located in a manner
          consistent with the standards of protection required under applicable
          law, for instance by entering into the appropriate back-to-back
          agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses for the
          transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46

        </p>
        <p>
          CBI’s Services are solely intended for business clients and are not
          directed at minors. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from
          children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and
          believe your child has provided us with Personal Data without your
          consent, please contact us as set forth below in Section XI, and we
          will take steps to delete such Personal Data from our systems.

          <b>VIII. Retention Periods</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          CBI shall typically retain Personal Data for the amount of time needed
          for the original purpose of collecting or obtaining such data.
          Appropriate retention periods are generally further determined by the
          nature and sensitivity of such Personal Data, including any potential
          risk of harm which could arise out of unauthorized use or disclosure,
          as well as whether additional legal/regulatory obligations require us
          to retain it. In most instances this means we shall only retain
          Personal Data during our relationship, where needed for tax or
          regulatory periods, or any statutory limitation periods under
          applicable laws.

        <p>
          Depending on applicable laws, you have certain rights regarding your
          Personal Data. These rights may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className="underscore">
              Right to access and/or rectify inaccuracies.

            You have the right to access Personal Data we hold about you and, in
            most circumstances, to be provided with a copy of this information.

            Personal Data which we hold.

            communications, it is preferable that we retain your basic contact
            information with a strict “do not contact” mark applied, to ensure
            we do not contact you in the future.

            Where we process your Personal Data on a legitimate interest basis

            right to object at any time to such processing without having to
            provide any specific reason for such objection. In such cases, we
            will stop processing your Personal Data until we verify that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your
            interests, rights, and freedoms in asking us to stop processing the
            data, or in limited cases where we need to continue processing the
            data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

            before its withdrawal.

          verify your identity (e.g., your name, address, email address, or
          other information reasonably required). If you are a California
          resident, please refer to Section X below for more detailed
          information on your rights under California law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use all efforts to respond to any legitimate requests within one
          month. In the event we require additional information, we will contact
          you and specify what is needed. In certain circumstances, it may take
          longer than one month, for example if we receive overly complex or
          numerous requests.

        <p>
          Occasionally it may take us longer than a month, taking into account
          the complexity and number of requests we receive. We do not charge a
          fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless
          it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine
          that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that
          decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
          request.

          of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify

          We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal

          days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in

          response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we
          will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
          option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
          preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we
          provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
          if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
          to provide your personal information that is readily useable and
          should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
          another entity without hindrance.

          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
